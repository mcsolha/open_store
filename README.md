# Coding problem: Sales Taxes

## Introduction

The goal of this challenge was to write an application that prints out  the receipt details for some shopping baskets.

## Architecture

The core idea of this project is to provide a simple API that enables to implement a store with a shopping cart that can generate an receipt for the client.

Since the API is ready, a Spring MVC Application should be developed which consumes the Core API, persisting all the data inside an MySQL Database and serves the application using Apache Tomcat. The user could interact with the application through Thymeleaf templates to retrieve and show all  the information from the shopping cart.

## TODO

* Create more Unit Tests using JUnit.
* Implement the Spring MVC application.
